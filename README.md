# codestrips
Codestrips is a small application to allow users to create and save small one-pane comic strips.
You can select a head, body, background location, thought/speech bubble type, thought/speech bubble text, and caption for a strip. By the end of this project, you’ll be able to save these to a SQLite database and retrieve them so that they persist even when you restart your server.

I’ll use your knowledge of Express, SQLite, and the sqlite3 node module in order to create a Strip table and then set up a POST route for creating new strips and a GET route to retrieve all strips from the database.
